# iMapView Codex Instructions

These instructions apply to all work performed in this repository.

## Do not modify unless explicitly requested

Do not modify the following unless the user explicitly requests it:

- *.pbxproj
- shared *.xcscheme files
- Signing settings
- Bundle identifiers
- Entitlements
- Deployment targets
- Version numbers
- MARKETING_VERSION
- CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION
- Info.plist (unless directly required)

Report any incidental changes and revert them unless instructed otherwise.

---

## Normal validation

Before reporting completion:

- Run `git diff --check` in the relevant repository.
- Ensure the working tree contains only the expected changes.
- Build the relevant target if appropriate.
- Report all modified files.
- Do not commit or push unless explicitly requested.

---

## Build Destination

Prefer building and testing on a connected physical Apple device whenever possible.

Do not change the selected Run Destination unless explicitly requested.

Do not automatically switch to a Simulator unless:

- explicitly requested by the user, or
- no suitable physical device is available.

If a Simulator must be used, explain why.

---

## Simulator

Prefer physical Apple devices over Simulator whenever possible.

Do NOT:

- repeatedly boot or recreate simulators
- create multiple simulator instances
- repeatedly retry failed simulator launches
- automatically switch from a physical device to Simulator

If the same Simulator operation fails twice:

- stop
- explain the failure
- propose manual next steps

---

## Xcode Automation

Avoid repeated retries.

If Xcode, Device Hub, Preview, Asset Catalog compilation, Icon Composer, Simulator, or related tooling appears stuck:

- wait for completion
- retry once if appropriate
- otherwise stop and explain

Do not spend excessive time attempting automatic recovery.

After a successful build or test:

- stop unless additional work was explicitly requested
- report the result

---

## Assets

When generating or modifying assets:

- generate once
- verify the result
- stop if the tool hangs

Do not repeatedly regenerate identical assets.

---

## Video Analysis

When analyzing uploaded videos:

- attempt decoding once
- retry with one alternative method if appropriate

If decoding still fails:

- stop
- report the likely codec or container issue
- suggest exporting as H.264 MP4 or providing screenshots

Do not spend long periods repeatedly attempting unsupported decoding.

---

## Token Usage

Prefer efficient execution.

Avoid loops that repeatedly perform nearly identical actions.

When progress stalls:

- summarize findings
- ask for guidance

rather than consuming excessive context or tokens.

---

## Build & Tests

Avoid repeated build cycles.

If the same build or test fails twice for the same reason:

- stop
- explain the root cause
- suggest a fix

---

## Git

Do NOT:

- force push
- rewrite history
- rebase
- delete branches

unless explicitly requested.

Always describe commits before creating them.

Do not commit or push unless explicitly requested.

---

## User Preference

The user values:

- deterministic behavior
- minimal project changes
- preserving repository structure
- explicit explanations over repeated automated retries
- physical device testing whenever practical

When in doubt, stop and ask rather than making assumptions.

## Safety First

Never modify Apple-managed development infrastructure unless explicitly requested by the user.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- CoreSimulator
- Simulator devices and runtimes
- DeviceSupport
- Provisioning Profiles
- Xcode UserData
- Xcode preferences

Default behavior:

- Analyze ✔
- Report ✔
- Recommend ✔
- Modify ✘

Only modify these locations after an explicit user instruction.

This rule takes precedence over general cleanup requests. If a cleanup request could affect any of the locations above, analyze and report only unless the user explicitly authorizes the modification.
